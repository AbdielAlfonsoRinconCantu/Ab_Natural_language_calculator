# Natural language calculator #
This program solves arithmetic operations entered in natural language by the user using python's math module.  

## **Features** ##  
- Accepts natural language format.
- Supports math functions such as log, ln, sqrt, sin, cos, tan, e, pi and cbrt.
- Handles math and syntax errors.

## Requirements ##
- Python.

## **How to use** ##  
1. Clone the repository or download the "Ab_NLC_1.0" module.
2. Import the module into your Python project.
3. Utilize the calculate_expression() function to perform calculations.
4. Run the main program to interactively use the natural language calculator.

## **Notes** ##  
- Ensure valid operation inputs.
- Avoid using unsafe inputs for the eval() function.

## **How it works** ##  
- Global: the calculate_expression function calculates the result of the user input after translating the input to python.
- Main: prompts the user to enter an operation or exit, this input is processed by the calculate_expression function.
